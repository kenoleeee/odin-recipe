    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Matzah, or matzo, is a crispy unleavened bread that's eaten during Passover. Tradition dictates the matzah should
        be
        made and baked within 18 minutes. Baking at a high temperature helps you achieve the perfect crunch.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon all-purpose flour for dusting</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup water, or more if needed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or as needed (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Move an oven rack to the top position. Preheat a heavy
            baking sheetin the oven.</li>
        <li>Dust a clean work surface and a rolling pin with 1 teaspoon flour, or as needed.</li>
        <li>Place 1 cup flour into a mixing bowl; set a timer for 16 minutes (18 minutes maximum).
            Start the timer; pour water, 1 tablespoon at a time, into flour. Stir with a fork until dough forms a rough
            ball.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to the prepared work surface; knead rapidly and firmly until smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>Divide dough into 4 equal-sized pieces; cut each piece in half to get 8 pieces. Swiftly roll each piece into
            a ball.
            Working from the center, roll out each dough piece into a 5-inch-diameter round, dusting with flour as
            needed. Continue
            to gradually roll dough out to a diameter of about 8 inches, increasing each size by about 1 inch, then
            letting dough
            rest for a few seconds before rolling again to the finished size. The dough rounds will be very thin.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to quickly pierce through each dough round about 25 times, all over, to prevent rising. Flip
            dough over and
            pierce each piece again 25 times.</li>
        <li>With at least 4-5 minutes left on the timer, remove the hot baking sheet from the preheated oven and place
            dough rounds
            onto the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake on the top rack in the preheated oven for 2 minutes; flip matzah over and bake until lightly browned
            and crisp,
            about 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Use a brush to lightly anoint each matzah with olive oil. Season generously
            with salt.</li>
    </ol>
